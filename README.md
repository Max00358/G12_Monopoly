You will build a game of Monopoly

You may make use of the Board and Coordinate classes or the Eleven's Lab starter code.

There will likely be some limitations to our Board class or the Elevens Lab that
require you to modify the rules or the scope of the game you are creating.
You will need to decide how to handle this.
